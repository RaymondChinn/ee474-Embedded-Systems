Personal portfolio of work from ee474 Embedded Systems

# Lab 3
Lab 3 focuses on serial communication using I2C, implementing non-preemptive scheduling algorithms, and the development and management of interrupts and ISRs for task handling.

# Lab 4
Lab 4 implements a shortest time remaining first preemptive algorithm, introduces parallel computing utilizing the dual-core architecture of the ESP32, and integrates these concepts using FreeRTOS. 

# Morse Code Translator
A real-time morse code translator implemented using FreeRTOS task management and the ESP32's dual core architecture to enable two main functionalities:
1) Morse code translation from physical button input to the ESP32 serial monitor
2) Direct, letter-by-letter translation of text input into audible Morse buzzes
